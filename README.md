# ipfs-cli-tryout

Try the js-ipfs cli in your browser!

> Currently very WIP (only a terminal with a few commands currently)

## Development

First prepare the shims and cli by running `bash prepare.sh`

Now run `npm run watch` to watch the assets and re-build the bundle on every change

That's it!
